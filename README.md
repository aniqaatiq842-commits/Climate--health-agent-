## 🚀 Project Overview

**ClimaHealth Agent** is an intelligent Streamlit web app built for the **Agentic AI Hackathon**.  
It consists of two main modules:

1. **Climate Health Agent (Main Page)**  
   - Uses **Open-Meteo API** (free, no key needed) to fetch real-time weather.
   - Analyzes the safety of current conditions for users’ **specific health issues** (asthma, heart disease, migraines, etc.).
   - Provides **agentic reasoning** and personalized health advice.

2. **💬 Climate Health Chatbot (Second Page)**  
   - A **smart offline chatbot** that explains how factors like pollution, humidity, or heat affect your health.
   - Works **without any API key** — it uses built-in reasoning logic.
   - Keeps **chat history** and has a clean, green-themed UI.
